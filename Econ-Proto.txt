Economics

   A Currency is a fungible unit. Any currency defined by the rules is
   an official currency. Circulation is a currency switch whose value is
   a non-negative integer, defaulting to 0.

   Account is a switch whose value is a list of each currency and
   their corresponding amount. A corresponding amount is a non-negative
   integer. If a currency ceases to be defined, its corresponding amount 
   becomes 0. If the corresponding amount is 0, the currency and its
   amount can be omitted from the list. If an amount would become
   negative it instead becomes 0; if any rule references an amount being
   or becoming negative, its related statements are interpreted before
   the amount becomes 0.

   To 'transfer' a specified amount of a specified currency from one
   account to another is to subtract the specified amount from the first 
   account's corresponding amount for the specified currency and add the 
   specified amount to the second account's corresponding amount for the 
   specified currency.

   Any player may transfer any amount of any currency to any other 
   player by announcement.

   Agora itself, each player, and each organization has an account. The
   total of each account's amount for a given currency SHALL equal the
   circulation for that currency. If the circulation of a given currency
   is increased or decreased, Agora's account's amount for that currency
   increases or decreases by as much. A currency's circulation CANNOT be
   decreased by more than Agora's account's amount for that currency.
   
   Currency Head is an official currency switch whose value is an
   office or player. A currency head MAY set the circulation for eir
   currency once a month. The circulation and amount in each account for
   eir currency is part of a Currency Head's weekly report if the
   Currency Head is an office.

Credits

   Credits is a currency. The Bankor is the Currency Head for credits.

   The Tax Rate is a switch whose values are rational numbers between 0
   and 1 inclusive, defaulting to 0. The Bankor MAY set the Tax Rate
   once a month.

   In the first week of every month the Bankor SHALL 'collect taxes'.
   Collecting taxes is done by:

      a) For each player and organization, calculating a tax by:

            Tax = Credits amount in eir account * Tax Rate

      b) Transfering the tax from eir account to Agora's account

   In the first week of every month, after collecting taxes, that Bankor
   SHALL 'pay salaries'. Paying salaries is done by:

      a) For each player, calculating a salary by:

            Salary = 10 * (the number of offices e holds + 1)

      b) Transfering the salary from Agora's account to eir account.

Auctions and Roles

   Role is a player switch whose possible values are 'None', 'Stamp
   Collection', 'Dismission', and 'Something Else' and whose default
   value is 'None'. If a player's role is None, e may change eir role
   by announcement. Otherwise a player may change eir role, by
   announcement, by transfering 10 credits to Agora's account.

   A Lot is a subset of the amounts of at least one currency in Agora's
   account. A Lot SHALL NOT list more than the amount in Agora's account
   for any currency.

   When a player is deregistered,

      * a lot identical to eir account is created and assigned to the
        Bankor,

      * the amount e had in eir account for every currency is transfered
        from eir account to agora's account.

   Once a month, each Currency Head for an official currency that is not
   Credits MAY create, by announcement, a lot containing only eir
   currency and an amount. Such a lot is assigned to the Currency Head
   that created it.

   In the last week of each month, each Currency Head SHALL initiate an
   auction for all lots assigned to em.

   An Auction is an event that last 7 days after being initiated. During
   an auction, every eligible player may propose an amount of credits to
   pay for the auction. Every player is eligible for auctions assigned
   to the Bankor.

   When an auction event ends, the player who proposed the highest
   number of credits that is not higher than the amount in eir account
   SHALL be the winner of the auction. In a timely manner, the assigned 
   Currency Head SHALL:

      a) Transfer the proposed credits from the winner's account to
         Agora's account, and

      b) For every currency listed in the lot, transfering the amount
         listed from Agora's account to the winner's account.
