PROPOSAL 1 (Credits, the Bankor, and Currency Framework)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the following rule titled 'The Bankor':

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Bankor is an office. The Bankor is the Currency Head for Credits.

   The Bankor's Weekly Report includes:

      * The circulation amount and amount in each account for Credits.

   The Bankor's Monthly Report includes:

      * A list of all currently-defined currencies, whether they are
        official, and their circulation amount.

      * A list of every account's value.

      * The Tax Rate for Credits.

   The Bankor's duties also include:

      * Setting the Tax Rate

      * Collecting Taxes

      * Paying Salaries

      * Running Deregistration Auctions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the following rule titled 'Economics':

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A Currency is a fungible unit. Any currency defined by the rules is
   an official currency.

   For each currency, Agora itself, every player, and every organization
   has a corresponding switch whose potential values are non-negative
   integers and whose default value is 0. These switches are refered to
   in the form <Entity>'s <Currency> Balance, or referred to
   collectively as <Entity>'s Account. Agora's Account is also known as
   the Treasury. If a balance is 0, it MAY be omitted and implied when
   listing an entire account.

   To 'transfer' a specified amount of a specified currency from one
   Entity to another is to decrease the first Entity's balance by the
   specified amount and increase the second Entity's balance by the
   specified amount. A transfer CANNOT occur if the specified amount
   is greater than the first Entity's balance.

   Any player MAY transfer any positive amount from emself to any other
   player by announcement.

   Circulation is a currency switch whose value is a non-negative
   integer, defaulting to 0. The total of each balance for a currency
   SHALL equal the circulation for that currency. If the circulation for
   a currency is increased or decreased, the treasury's balance for that
   currency is increased or decreased by the same amount. A currency's
   circulation CANNOT be decreased by more than the treasury's balance
   for that currency.

   If a person ceases being a player, or an organization ceases
   existing, eir balance for each official currency is transfered to the
   treasury.

   Currency Head is an official currency switch whose value is an office
   or player. A currency head CAN set the circulation for eir currency
   once a month by announcement. The circulation and amount in each
   account for eir currency is part of a Currency Head's weekly report
   if the Currency Head is an office.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the following rule titled 'Credits':

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Credits is a currency. The Bankor is the Currency Head for credits.

   The Tax Rate is a singleton switch whose values are rational numbers
   between 0 and 1 inclusive, defaulting to 0. The Bankor CAN set the
   Tax Rate once a month.

   In the first week of every month the Bankor SHALL 'collect taxes'.
   Collecting taxes is done by:

      a) For each player and organization, calculating a tax by:

            Tax = Ceiling(Credits amount in eir account * Tax Rate)

      b) Transfering the tax from eir account to Agora's account

   In the first week of every month, after collecting taxes, that Bankor
   SHALL 'pay salaries'. Paying salaries is done by:

      a) For each player, calculating a salary by:

            Salary = 10 * (the number of offices e holds + 1)

      b) Transfering the salary from Agora's account to eir account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL 2 (Auctions and Other Currencies)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the following rule titled "Auctions and Roles":

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Role is a player switch whose possible values are 'None', 'Stamp 
   Collection', 'Dismission', and 'Instigation' and whose default value
   is 'None'. If a player's role is None, e can change eir role by 
   announcement. Otherwise a player can change eir role, by 
   announcement, by transferring 10 credits to the treasury.

   A Lot is a list of currencies and corresponding positive integers. A
   Lot SHALL NOT list more than the amount in the treasury for any
   currency.

   When a player is deregistered,

      * a lot identical to eir account is created and assigned to the
        Bankor,

      * for every currency, eir balance is transfered to the treasury.

   Once a month, each Currency Head for an official currency that is not
   Credits CAN create, by announcement, a lot containing only eir
   currency and an amount. Such a lot is assigned to the Currency Head
   that created it.

   In the last week of each month, each Currency Head SHALL initiate an
   auction for all lots assigned to em.

   An Auction is an event that last 7 days after being initiated. During
   an auction, every eligible player CAN propose an amount of credits to
   pay for the auction. Every player is eligible for auctions assigned
   to the Bankor, unless otherwise stated. Any player on lockout is not
   eligible for any auction.

   When an auction event ends, the player who proposed the highest
   number of credits that is not higher than the amount in eir account
   SHALL be the winner of the auction. In a timely manner, the assigned 
   Currency Head SHALL:

      a) Transfer the proposed credits from the winner's account to
         the treasury, and

      b) For every currency listed in the lot, transferring the amount
         listed from the treasury to the winner's account.

read:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
   proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
   "not pending" (default).

   Stamps is a currency. The Currency Head for Stamps is the Prime
   Minister. Players of the Stamp Collection role are eligible for
   auctions assigned to the Stamps Currency Head, unless otherwise
   stated elsewhere.
   
   Once a month, a player can flip the immence of a proposal e submitted
   to "pending" by announcement.

   A player can flip a proposal's imminence to "pending" by transfering
   1 Stamp from eir account to Agora's account by announcement.

      The Income Cap is 100.

      Budget is a switch belonging to (Organization, player) pairs
      (i.e. there is one instance of the switch for each combination
      of an Organization and a player), tracked by the Secretary,
      whose legal values are integers from 0 to the Income Cap 
      inclusive, defaulting to 0. An Organization's Income is the 
      total value of all Budget switches for pairs that include that 
      Organization. A player's Expenditure is the total value of all 
      Budget switches for pairs that include that player. Changes to 
      Budget are secured.

      b) Any player CAN flip a Budget Switch by announcement, if doing
         so is Appropriate and the player is not on Lockout, except
         where other rules prevent this.

Also amend 2459 to change "c)" to "b)".

Amend 2461 (Death and Birth of Organizations) to read:

   announcement by transferring 10 credits to the treasury and
   specifying both a unique name and a Charter. When an organization is
   created this way, its Charter is set to the value that e specified.  
   Notwithstanding the above, a player CANNOT create more than one
   Organization in a day
