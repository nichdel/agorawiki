Economics

   A Currency is a fungible unit. Any currency defined by the rules is
   an official currency.

   Account is a switch whose value is a list of each currency and a
   corresponding integer. Agora itself, every player, and every
   organization has an account. Agora's account is also known as 'the 
   treasury'. To refer to a player's, organization's, or the treasury's
   'balance' for a specified currency is to refer to the corresponding 
   integer in eir account. If a balance is 0, it and its currency MAY
   be omitted from the list for that account in reports.

   If a balance is negative it becomes 0, but only after any effects
   described in other rules occur.

   To 'transfer' a specified amount of a specified currency from one
   account to another is to decrease the first account's balance by the
   specified amount and increase the second account's balance by the
   specified amount. If the first account's balance is less than the
   specified amount, the second account's balance is instead increased
   by the first account's balance.

   Any player MAY transfer any positive amount of any currency from eir
   account to any other specified account, by announcement.

   Circulation is a currency switch whose value is a non-negative
   integer, defaulting to 0. The total of each account's balance for
   a currency SHALL equal the circulation switch for that currency. If
   the circulation for a currency is increased or decreased, the
   treasury's balance for that currency is increased or decreased by the
   same amount. A currency's circulation CANNOT be decreased by more
   than the treasury's balance for that currency.

   Currency Head is an official currency switch whose value is an
   office or player. A currency head MAY set the circulation for eir
   currency once a month by announcement. The circulation and amount in
   each account for eir currency is part of a Currency Head's weekly
   report if the Currency Head is an office. 

Credits

   Credits is a currency. The Bankor is the Currency Head for credits.

   The Tax Rate is a switch whose values are rational numbers between 0
   and 1 inclusive, defaulting to 0. The Bankor MAY set the Tax Rate
   once a month.

   In the first week of every month the Bankor SHALL 'collect taxes'.
   Collecting taxes is done by:

      a) For each player and organization, calculating a tax by:

            Tax = Credits amount in eir account * Tax Rate

      b) Transfering the tax from eir account to Agora's account

   In the first week of every month, after collecting taxes, that Bankor
   SHALL 'pay salaries'. Paying salaries is done by:

      a) For each player, calculating a salary by:

            Salary = 10 * (the number of offices e holds + 1)

      b) Transfering the salary from Agora's account to eir account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auctions and Roles

   Role is a player switch whose possible values are 'None', 'Stamp
   Collection', 'Dismission', and 'Something Else' and whose default
   value is 'None'. If a player's role is None, e may change eir role
   by announcement. Otherwise a player may change eir role, by
   announcement, by transfering 10 credits to Agora's account.

   A Lot is a subset of the amounts of at least one currency in Agora's
   account. A Lot SHALL NOT list more than the amount in Agora's account
   for any currency.

   When a player is deregistered,

      * a lot identical to eir account is created and assigned to the
        Bankor,

      * the amount e had in eir account for every currency is transfered
        from eir account to agora's account.

   Once a month, each Currency Head for an official currency that is not
   Credits MAY create, by announcement, a lot containing only eir
   currency and an amount. Such a lot is assigned to the Currency Head
   that created it.

   In the last week of each month, each Currency Head SHALL initiate an
   auction for all lots assigned to em.

   An Auction is an event that last 7 days after being initiated. During
   an auction, every eligible player may propose an amount of credits to
   pay for the auction. Every player is eligible for auctions assigned
   to the Bankor.

   When an auction event ends, the player who proposed the highest
   number of credits that is not higher than the amount in eir account
   SHALL be the winner of the auction. In a timely manner, the assigned 
   Currency Head SHALL:

      a) Transfer the proposed credits from the winner's account to
         Agora's account, and

      b) For every currency listed in the lot, transfering the amount
         listed from Agora's account to the winner's account.
