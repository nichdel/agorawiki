# How to play Agora: a short guide

## The mailing lists

Agora is played using two types of email lists: public fora, for playing the game, and discussion fora. To get the full experience you really need to follow what's being said in both types. There's also an IRC channel for discussion, which is more optional.

You can sign up to the mailing lists using the links on [Agora's homepage](https://www.agoranomic.org/).

(Info on web interface.)

## Actions

You do things by saying that you do them to a public forum. If the rules say that you can do X, then you do it by sending a message to the mailing list saying "I do X." It's that simple. 

## Gameplay

## The rules

The [rules](Home#rules) are kept in two formats: the SLR, which just has the text of the rules themselves, and the FLR, which contains more contextual information. You shouldn't feel obliged to read them yet: the best way to learn is by playing.

## More questions?

Just ask! The [agora-discussion mailing list](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-discussion) is the best place to find out more. Someone will be more than happy to answer your questions.
