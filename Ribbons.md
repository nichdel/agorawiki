I award a Gray Ribbon to Sprocklem (because of... reasons).

This is a list of all persons owning Ribbons, detailing which ribbons
they possess:

The rules for Ribbons are set out in rule 2438. A quick guide to how
most Ribbons work: various events cause you to "earn" a Ribbon; you
then "qualify for" that Ribbon for 7 days. While you qualify for a
Ribbon (and do not already own that Ribbon, and have not owned it
recently), any player can "award" you that Ribbon. A few Ribbons
work differently; see rule 2438 for details.

Approximate summary of how each type of Ribbon can be gained:
+Red          Author a proposal that is adopted, amending a Power-3+rule
+Orange       Author a proposal that is unanimously adopted
+Green        Hold an elected office for 30 days with no late duties
+Cyan         Deputise for an office
+Blue         Judge a CFJ without violating time limits to do so
+Magenta      Acknowldge Agora's Birthday
+Ultraviolet  Become Champion (typically by winning the game)
+Violet       Gain a Patent Title (except Champion, degrees)
+Indigo       Gain a degree
+Platinum     Become the Speaker
+Lime         Coauthor three adopted proposals within 7 days
+White        Never have had a White Ribbon, or be gifted one by someone
              who has never gifted a White Ribbon
+blacK        Awardable only by proposal or scam
+GraY         Awarded monthly at the Tailor's discretion
